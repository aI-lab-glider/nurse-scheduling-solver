# Nurse Scheduling Problem Solver

The algorithm implementation is a part of a solution created for [Fundacja Rodzin Adopcyjnych](https://adopcja.org.pl), the adoption foundation in Warsaw (Poland) during Project Summer [AILab](http://www.ailab.agh.edu.pl) & [Glider](http://www.glider.agh.edu.pl) 2020 event. The aim of the system is to improve the operation of the foundation by easily and quickly creating work schedules for its employees and volunteers. So far, this has been done manually in spreadsheets, which is a cumbersome and tedious job.

The solution presented here is problem-specific. It assumes a specific form of input and output schedules, which was adopted in the foundation for which the system is created. The schedules themselves are adjusted based on the rules of the Polish Labour Code.

The system consists of three components which are on two GitHub repositories:

 - web application which lets load a schedule and set its basic requirements (detailed information [here](https://github.com/Project-Summer-AI-Lab-Glider/nurse-scheduling-problem-frontend))
 - solver written in Julia which adjusts schedules
 - backend also written in Julia ([Genie framework](https://genieframework.com/)) which allows for communication of both aforementioned components

This repository contains the solver and the backend.

## Backend

1. Clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Project-Summer-AI-Lab-Glider/nurse-scheduling-problem-solver.git
```

2. Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd nurse-scheduling-problem-solver
```

3. Run server.

```bash
julia --project=. src/server.jl
```

### Endpoints

* POST `/fix_schedule`

  body - JSON - schedule

  response - JSON - repaired_schedule

* POST `/schedule_errors`

  body - JSON - schedule

  response - JSON - errors


## Supported work shifts

|Shift code|Shift          |Work-time|Equivalent|
|:--------:|---------------|:-------:|:--------:|
|    R     |morning        |  7-15   |    -     |
|    P     |afternoon      |  15-19  |    -     |
|    D     |daytime        |  7-19   |  R + P   |
|    N     |night          |  19-7   |    -     |
|    DN    |day            |   7-7   |  D + N   |
|    PN    |afternoon-night|  15-7   |  P + N   |
|    W     |day free       |   N/A   |    -     |
|    U     |vacation       |   N/A   |    -     |
|    L4    |sick leave     |   N/A   |    -     |

## Constraints

 - always at least one nurse
 - from 6 to 22 at least one worker for each 3 children
 - from 22 to 6 at least one worker for each 5 children
 - after DN shift 24h off, after PN 16h and after the rest 11h
 - each worker has 35h off once a week (counted from MO to SU)
 - undertime and overtime hours
 - U and L4 untouchable (implicit constraint)

## Front-end communication

Broken constraints are tracked and the information is passed to front-end in a JSON list.

Table of error codes and their description:

|Constraints                    |Code|Other keys                                                     |
|-------------------------------|:--:|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Always at least one nurse      |AON |day::Int, day_time::(“MORNING”&#124;”AFTERNOON”&#124;”NIGHT”)  |
|Workers number during the day  |WND |day::Int, required::Int, actual::Int                           |
|Workers number during the night|WNN |day::Int, required::Int, actual::Int                           |
|Disallowed shift sequence      |DSS |day::Int, worker::String, preceding::Shifts, succeeding::Shifts|
|Lacking long break             |LLB |week::Int, worker::String                                      |
|Worker undertime hours         |WUH |hours::Int, worker::String                                     |
|Worker overtime hours          |WOH |hours::Int, worker::String                                     |

Sample JSON list of broken constraints:

```json
[
    {
      "code": "WND",
      "day": 7,
      "required": 4,
      "actual": 3
    },
    {
      "code": "LLB",
      "worker": "babysitter_7",
      "week": 1
    },
    {
      "code": "DSS",
      "day": 4,
      "worker": "nurse_4",
      "preceding": "DN",
      "succeeding": "P"
    }
]
```

## Neighborhood generator

- only MutationRecipes are stored in Neighborhood

```julia
MutationRecipe = @NamedTuple{
    type::Mutation.MutationEnum,
    day::Int,
    wrk_no::IntOrTuple,
    op::StringOrNothing,
}
```
- full shifts (2d arrays) are generated on demand
- Neighborhood is immutable
- partial neighborhood can be generated by passing shifts which can not be changed
